Energy-based control system

This is a pedantic attempt at realizing multi-tenant, distributed interactions backed by data.

The implementation is browser-based (for ubiquity's sake) and is composed of:
- Local actor/action loop
- Local communication service
- Federated communication hub
- Federal actor/action resolver
